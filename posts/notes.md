## TOC outline

> for DHQ: critical code studies version
> All Code Is Writing, All Writing Is Code: Brief Manifestos for Creative-Critical-Code

1. a provocation
   1. subject/description
   2. problem/gap
   3. why/so what
   4. overview - in brief of ideal platform
      1. key components, 
      2. qualities/characteristics, 
      3. goals/outcomes
2. DHQ: case studies
   1. write around about the code: literate programming > notebooks
   2. use code tools to write, improve the tools to help writing: writing with github < AP, penflip et al, Jeremy's
   3. make code itself more inviting, use code itself to write: KY & compassionate errors & invented
3. CARPA: ideal platform - tethered imagined, IAI
   1. key components, 
   2. qualities/characteristics, 
   3. goals/outcomes
4. POM: (other paper) how it works as applied
   1. struggles
   2. learned
5. conclusion

> for CARPA: writing and performance and artistic research methods
> BRIEF MANIFESTOS FOR DIGITAL WRITING PLATFORMS OF THE FUTURE: Creative-Critical-Code Writing As Artistic Research and Performance

> for POM: through the lens of the IAIT project, workshop outcomes added after draft. intersectional emphasis
> Brief Manifestos for Future Platforms: Creative-Critical-Code Writing Toward Intersectional Systems

What will each version do that extends my research independent of the others, what question will it ask or extend?
1. D - survey, lay out ideal, code side
   1. existing examples are neither code poetry in one extreme nor over privileging code as it subject in the other extreme
      1. code is not the sole subject matter of code. writings on code so far have been ABOUT code, its execution instead of allowing code to BE WITH other writing where those contextual shared meanings can emerge. (trin t minh ha)
      2. this has been denied except in code poetry, where that (CP) has been sidelined as esoteric and non functional and also in its own way about code. All of this persists the illusion that code is separate from, rather than embedded in, the operating codes of the world, that it is specialized language for the technical monks not the people. 
      3. it is always already in relation to what it is executing/meaning linguistically 
      4. needs to make legible its closer relationship to the other forms of writing AS writing
   2. need to rethink how we do code critique... or how we do code situated ness in humanities, in a broader way that is more literary and arts and humanities based
      1. would lead to more potentials that are egalitarian and expressive and reflective of the world as it is, as it could be... queer critical creative code writing
2. C - writing and performance and process oriented, failure circle
   1. meaning making through code-writing hybrids, the performance/materiality of making with material, ongoingness... exploded diagrams of car repair

3. P - applied version: HIIG results, zine, a Branch of IAI for workshop edits

>not form but force, not content but materials (ingold)
>nardi


**presentation style: web, gifs, demo as/on platform if possible? **

## translucent code

this is the goal, translucent code, translucent text, and meaning nested in its material conditions of both. 

- allows for *end-user programming* (>Nardi) more egalitarian relationships with code
- dismantles (re-entangle) the user-dev binary
- also creative code collective model for more open teaching and exposures to code learning
- makes tools that reveal their own processes, a process-oriented ethic rather than hiding their gears, 
- to trace the authors and origins is a politic and an ethic

requires new more capacious forms that cross genre/content borders and can hold ideas gently and can welcome in uncertainty



## cms is content
### Managing content is content is code is a flat circle

I am writing this from a headless CMS, a horseman skinned over Github as I try to make sense of the ways I might make layering coding and other forms of writing easier and more transparent for myself and others, and yet the more I dig in the more tangled I've gotten myself.

So many tools exist, are being created, are being imagined, and none of them are quite right (for me), are doing the things I am hoping for and I suppose the frustrating lesson I am taking from this is how hemmed in / constrained both for better and worse we are by our materials and our tools. Like, duh. But also as they become transparent when we hold them, the "limits of our language" and the "limits of our world" become transparent too, we need new tools to have new lenses. We need to break our old tools, to duct tape them together into new Frankenstein's monstrocities of analog-digital exuberance.

And yet I have seen the toolkits go out of business, fall out of favor, refuse to persist or be maintained. Digital decay is real and organic. It smells and feels personal. It tires the body and corrodes at the metal edges of projects if they sit for too long untouched with the batteries in.

#### 2021.06.28

I've come, feeling sheepish and stupid about this, to discover this is called minimal computing, and it's long been suggested that I aim for minimum viable product rather than the grand unscopeable schemes my research brain cooks up once I get a fire lit under me. But as I write that, I think the one supports the other, really. Minimal computing allows us to dive in head first, without too much disorientation (while at the same time it perhaps isn't pushing us too far out of our boundaries from known forms)... where is that sweet spot, that growth edge where the magic of newâ€”or better yet, refreshing (because Pound's make-it-new is detestably old and hegemonic).

Writing again now with content manageless, making one's own system, or the system itself is the story, the metadata is the data, the file tree determines how the files emerge. And *this* is the reason for translucent layers between code and other kinds of writing, or as the programmers might call it when arguing for separation, between the business layer and the data layer, that is, the action and the acted upon, the force and the material. And yes, nuance and separation is essential, but to act as if these separations are static, persistent, natural, seems foolhearty and prone to miss so much richness and joy in the tension of their relation, ner, ~oneness~, threadedness. A thread pulled taut is a very different object than one slack, requires relations to its either end to exist, is not itself without its tension forces, nor is the tension much without its tangible material. And the warp and weft of many deft lines pulled crossways combine into a surface to act against. What is Relational is not only interactive but intra-active, inter/intra-subjective. So you see where my scoping issues arise.

minimal computing which allows for combo of max layering of **transluscent** code.
