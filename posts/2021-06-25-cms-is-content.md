## Managing content is content is code is a flat circle

I am writing this from a headless CMS, a horseman skinned over Github as I try to make sense of the ways I might make layering coding and other forms of writing easier and more transparent for myself and others, and yet the more I dig in the more tangled I've gotten myself.

So many tools exist, are being created, are being imagined, and none of them are quite right (for me), are doing the things I am hoping for and I suppose the frustrating lesson I am taking from this is how hemmed in / constrained both for better and worse we are by our materials and our tools. Like, duh. But also as they become transparent when we hold them, the "limits of our language" and the "limits of our world" become transparent too, we need new tools to have new lenses. We need to break our old tools, to duct tape them together into new Frankenstein's monstrocities of analog-digital exuberance.

And yet I have seen the toolkits go out of business, fall out of favor, refuse to persist or be maintained. Digital decay is real and organic. It smells and feels personal. It tires the body and corrodes at the metal edges of projects if they sit for too long untouched with the batteries in.
