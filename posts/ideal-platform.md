### a process, a material, a form, a platform


### ideal platform (discussion)

A speculative platform for creative-critical-code writing should have these qualities--identified across publishing, programming, and social content management systems (CMS): 
- it's editable
- it's *operable/executable* 
- it's remixable (forking, modular, adaptable)
- it's engageable (commentable, shareable) 
- it's citable/sourceable (modular licensing)
- it's traceable (version tracking, attribution)
- it's language-agnostic (programming is writing)
- it's useful, even fun, INVITING, generative, creative, inspiring
- it's readable/legible/understandable, accessible (are these the same--view it, understand it?)
- it's portable: deplatformable, cross-publishable, distributed/standardized? cloud-hosted/shared
- it's engaging community (represents different interactions 1:1, 1:many, many:many, self:self) 
- it's process-oriented (pre-to-post publication workflow (drafts, revisions, editions; development & production)
- it's robust (enough to withstand the above, which may mean minimalist)
- it's political (ethical, doesn't shy away from its values, embedded in its community)

LEGIBLE: approachable, learnable
MEANINGFUL: participates in material & semantic significance
COMMUNAL: performative, process-oriented, community creativity

comes from two behaviors
TRACEABLE: 
- structurally: FORK, MERGE, MOD, REMIX 
- discursively: COMMENT, ATTRIBUTE
TRANSLUCENT
- structurally: layering meaning
- discursively: accessing learning


### how to invite people in from other disciplines

>>"They gravitate toward zines that are visibly different from magazines and other mainstream publications, either by virtue of size or hand-colored drawings or their sheer unprofessional appearance. [...] Many of them seem to feel personally invited to enter into the zine discourse, as is evidenced by the fact that they begin creating zines of their own." (Piepmeier 2009, 57-58)
>>GIFT culture: "gift culture: little eddies of artifacts accrue around grrrl zines, circulating between zine readers and creators. Zines instigate intimate, affectionate connections between their creators and readers, not just communities but what I am calling embodied communities, made possible by the materiality of the zine medium" (Piepmeier 2009, 58) 
>"By mobilizing particular human experiences that are linked to the body, including vulnerability, affection, and pleasure, these zines leverage their materiality into a kind of surrogate physical interaction and offer mechanisms for creating meaningful relationships." (59)


>"Computing work must therefore be distributed across the people in an organizatìon, not bottlenecked at programming professionals. One piece of the solution to the productivity puzzle then, is to increase the value of computers by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness with which ordinary people use computers to build the applications they need." (Nardi 1993, 123)
>"the overriding goal is to leverage users' skills and interests in the design of a programming system." (Nardi 1993, 124)
>"The importance of task-specificity in end user systems suggests that the problem of helping end users to be more productive with computers does not lie in extensive education, or in providing scripting languages that are general-purpose but easy" to use, or in finding the ultimate interaction technique. Rather, designers should start with a clear sense of and respect for the tasks that end users will be doing, and then design a system that best supports those tasks." (125)
>**"a recipe for successful end user programming systems includes task specific programming languages, visual application frameworks, and support for collaborative computing practices." (Nardi 1993, 125)**



### process

- many false starts, many attempts at cobbling together imperfect platforms before realizing that it was a complete paradigm shift I am describing? 
- is this a browser extension, a code library, a misuse of an existing tool, a syntax convention and text-scraping script, etc. (Queer Use) ... this is an unanswered question, still imaginging the perfect tool and failing to build it but struggling to find it and tinkering to build it is the way to avoid the writing/thinking

> BRIEF MANIFESTOS FOR DIGITAL WRITING PLATFORMS OF THE FUTURE: 
> **Creative-Critical-Code Writing As Artistic Research and Performance**

Thank you to CARPA for this panel. I'm excited to join my fellow panelists and for the chance to speak on this topic. I'm Sarah Ciston, a Mellon Fellow and PhD Candidate at USC, where I research how to make AI more intersectional. My background is in creative writing and creative-critical coding, which I explore through artistic research that does weird things with text-based machine learning to discover its limits and its possibilities. 

Today I will talk about my practice of creative-critical-code writing as artistic research. I think of this as both a hybrid practice and a possible shift in how we consider digital writing platforms. I'm especially interested in how to bring more ethical and equitable practices to existing spaces and the new ones we create. 

SLIDE?

Most of our approaches to programming languages consider them only and entirely separate from the other written content they supports—that is to say, the writing (or so-called natural language and other material they are meant to execute. By this understanding, code is abstracted away, under the hood, behind the scenes, meant to work without the end-user's understanding. The concept of abstraction, its presumed utility, has been so fundamental to computer science that it can be difficult to see beyond it in order to imagine scenarios where other values might emerge. Yet, opportunities for creative encounters and entire realms of programming's utility may be missed because of a narrow insistence that it is "for" some folks and not others. And that these select few can act upon all of us as the invisible "quote unquote neutral" hand of the machine.

BONNIE: Bonnie Nardi says that "Computer-centric terms such as **'novice'** obscure the possibilities for creating appropriate end user systems and **are prejudicial** in assigning prominence to the computer."

Inspired by intersectional feminist approaches and by work in critical code studies and cross-genre writing, I have set out to sketch a speculative creative-critical-code-writing platform. I'll outline the goals and impacts of that platform, some characteristics it would need to have in order to achieve these goals, which would distinguish it from existing spaces and modalities, and then I'll show a few concrete examples from my own research practice that help illustrate these ideas, which I'm continuing to build on as I develop a prototype platform. 


HISTORY: I'd like to mention that... existing platforms do hint at the possibilities for creative-critical-code writing in many ways but do not exploit its possibilities fully. For example, plenty of writers are beginning to use Git and Github to do version control on their writing, but it remains a very unfriendly onboarding experience for anyone coming from outside the software and computer science industries, as it was designed strictly for these processes. Previous attempts to think code and writing together, while legitimately fascinating, have always made code their primary focus. 

SCARE: Describing her code poetry net art piece “Code Scares Me”, Jessica Loseby says, “the prospect of a language that is both hidden and alien to me haunts my work on the net. Like most prejudices, it is born out of fear. I am afraid of what lies buried within the under text.” In the video documentation of the piece, which is now unavailable thanks to the death of FLASH, the experience is riddled with an excess of HTML code overwhelming the primary text fragments like *if only I could see you and you could see me* but adding all kinds of meaningful easter eggs. Her work hints at the same desire I have for code layers to surface and be legible and meaningful, albeit less overwhelmingly so than in Loseby's early 2000s example.

Code poetry, which came up during 1990s net art era, used the languages and syntax of programming to write poems, and many of these were still viable as executable code. However, while these played with writing and code together, they remained esoteric and exclusive rather than reaching a broad audience among readers or programmers or able to bridge those gaps. 

BACK: Rewinding a bit further, Literate Programming, a concept established by Donald Knuth in the 1970s, flipped the focus of software writing, so that rather than writing source code with a bit of documentation, the programmer was instructed to write robust documentation surrounding code. The primary text was the document describing what the code would do, the comments outweighed the executable lines, in a way. And although it does attempt to humanize programming, the focus of literate programming is still on writing code. Thus, it's not enough of a paradigm shift for the creative-critical-code writing hybrids that I am trying to advocate for today.

MEDIUM: Same cases in point with the writing platforms that are accessible to many users but offer very little in the way of access to what makes the code that supports the writing run. 
Sites like Medium do offer ...



JEROME: The problem is that the shift is not considered as a true overhaul, as far as I can tell. To wit, Jerome McGann argues that “Digital tools have **yet to develop models** for displaying and replicating **the self-reflexive operations** of bibliographical tools [...] for **transforming storage into memory, and data into knowledge**. We have to design and build digital environments for those purposes.” I suggest this requires more than an upgrade of features, but an actual reconfiguration of the relationship between natural and machinic languages, one that dissolves the areas where we have artificially divided them.

Each kind of language does indeed have unique characteristics, and it is important not to lose that nuance in the process. However, in specialization, let's not also lose the opportunity to think and write them together in more complex and in depth ways, which we have done by separating them into the work of users or writers, and developers or coders. 



1. process over product, community collaboration, access, legibility, and the plat/form-content relationship
      1. comes from two behaviors
      2. TRACEABLE: 
         1. - structurally: FORK, MERGE, MOD, REMIX 
         2. - discursively: COMMENT, ATTRIBUTE
      3. TRANSLUCENT
         1. - structurally: layering meaning
         2. - discursively: accessing learning


IMPACT: The impact of this would be to unravel the false binary between users and developers, re-engaging us with our tools. It would allow for what Bonnie Nardi calls "end-user programming", where the folks who create with digital tools have more egalitarian relationships with the code they use, rather than being subject strictly to the uses imagined by its designers. This would also open up space for more process-oriented approaches and ethics, rather than final product motivated work. Process-oriented approaches let us trace authors and origins, which carries political weight, particularly in meme culture. Plus, when explainability is foregrounded and tools reveal their own processes, this can provide more open teaching models and broader exposure to casual, accessible, egalitarian teaching and learning. All this requires new, capacious forms that are willing to cross genre and content boarders and that can hold new paradigms tenderly and destabilize categories. 


GOALS: So, in order to make this leap, how do we do this? I started with a laundry list of ideas, a lengthy collection of characteristics for what I imagined a creative-critical-code writing platform would require... most of which I spotted on other existing platforms. I've been scouring the Web 2.0 to see if I could duct-tape together my dream platform, but nothing has been quite right. It should have the sociability, comment-friendly interface, and recommendation system of a streamlined writing platform like Medium.com. It should have version tracking and comparable diffs like GitHub. It should be modular and open-source and portable. 


SLIDE: I've starting to put together what these aspects have in common, and I've started to distill it down to a few key areas. Namely, all the aspects of the speculative platform focused FIRST around LEGIBILITY so that it could be accessible, approachable, and offer learning; SECOND around creating MEANING through layered connections between the kinds of language in tangible ways; THIRD around A LIVELY COMMUNITY that is collaborative and always in-process. 

SLIDE: My sense so far is that this comes from two traits in particular, that run across all aspects of this speculative platform: TRACEABILITY and TRANSPARENCY. 

With traceable texts, we aim for forkable, mergeable, modifyable, remixable texts perhaps structured like platforms like Github.
Traceable texts are also connected through their systems of comments and attributions, which take inspiration from both Github and Medium.

With transparent texts, we aim for layered structures that allow the meanings of code and natural languages to overlap and converge.
Transparent text also means accessible, legible approaches to learning that don't silo off specialized technical knowledge but foreground code as part of how discourse is produced.

Through this, perhaps we can start to imagine traceable and translucent code and text, with greater space for new forms of meaning and community created in the material conditions where they intersect. 






EXAMPLE: 
I'd love to share some examples from my own research where I see this happening and where I have started to put this into practice:

1. Platform experiments in visible code that bring the dev tools that are usually hidden in the web browser forward to be part of the text. In Chrome on a Mac you can right click an element and select Inspect, or a keyboard shortcut is Command+Option+I to bring up the page source, including html, any javascript, and CSS. But what if these were more readily visible through a browser extension or as part of the site itself, lowering the barrier between code and natural language text and lowering the barrier to entry to learning how code affects the other forms of writing it intersects with? Separating it off by hiding it in the developer tools as if only for already-skilled developers treats coding as an elite knowledge form and disallows the opportunity for potential coders to understand and influence these relationships like they could if code text and other writing could co-mingle.
   
2. A second example is in recent work I've undertaken with Mark Marino, in which we were invited to fork a book written on GitLab by Winnie Soon and Geoff Cox. Because the book was 




3. A third example to touch on briefly: I am exploring this in terms of platforms that take inspiration from print zines from the 1990s, both their aesthetic and material forms and their politics, their means of distribution through the world and their word of mouth collaborations. My prototype for this work is a series of zines on how to bring practices from Intersectional feminist, queer, and anti-racist communities to AI. It's hosted on github and edited through community workshops and print-digital hybrid distribution so that it remains a living document rather than being shaped by a single voice.

Ultimately I hope that these practices, these interfaces and their ideas can gesture toward an **ethics of code writing in community.** 

- One that acknowledges code and other forms of text are not so different. They already coexist in every space either occupies. They merge and blur, influence and drift. We are already alive and performing intertwined with them.

- One that acknowledges and makes legible that no one writes (code or any other text) in a vacuum. We are influenced and we influence, we are responsible to one another. 

- One that acknowledges code is a commons. It isn't owned, but rather it is a set of enacted stories about what we imagine *could and should* be in the world, what could and should connect us. If code acts, if it *makes things happen*, what do we want to happen? For and with *whom*? And which stories still need telling? 

Thank you!
