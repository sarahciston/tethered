### a process, a material, a form, a platform

Thank you to CARPA for this panel. I'm excited to join my fellow panelists and for the chance to speak on this topic. I'm Sarah Ciston, a Mellon Fellow and PhD Candidate at USC, where I research how to make AI more intersectional. My background is in creative writing and creative-critical coding, which I explore through artistic research that does weird things with text-based machine learning to discover its limits and its possibilities. 

Today I will talk about the practice of creative-critical-code writing as artistic research. I want to think of this as both a hybrid practice and a possible shift in how we consider platforms. I'm especially interested in how to bring more ethical and equitable practices to existing spaces and the new ones we create. 

TOC: So first I will cover the case for new platforms and forms of hybrid writing, the qualities or characteristics I argue it needs to have that distinguish it from existing modes, and what existing spaces it's inspired by where we see it emerging already. Then I'll touch in particular on the aspects of this modality that are performative, process-oriented, and why that matters so much. Finally I'll talk about the important impacts of making this potential shift to creative-critical-code writing.




### ideal platform (discussion)

A speculative platform for creative-critical-code writing should have these qualities--identified across publishing, programming, and social content management systems (CMS): 
- it's editable
- it's *operable/executable* 
- it's remixable (forking, modular, adaptable)
- it's engageable (commentable, shareable) 
- it's citable/sourceable (modular licensing)
- it's traceable (version tracking, attribution)
- it's language-agnostic (programming is writing)
- it's useful, even fun, INVITING, generative, creative, inspiring
- it's readable/legible/understandable, accessible (are these the same--view it, understand it?)
- it's portable: deplatformable, cross-publishable, distributed/standardized? cloud-hosted/shared
- it's engaging community (represents different interactions 1:1, 1:many, many:many, self:self) 
- it's process-oriented (pre-to-post publication workflow (drafts, revisions, editions; development & production)
- it's robust (enough to withstand the above, which may mean minimalist)
- it's political (ethical, doesn't shy away from its values, embedded in its community)

### how to invite people in from other disciplines

>>"They gravitate toward zines that are visibly different from magazines and other mainstream publications, either by virtue of size or hand-colored drawings or their sheer unprofessional appearance. [...] Many of them seem to feel personally invited to enter into the zine discourse, as is evidenced by the fact that they begin creating zines of their own." (Piepmeier 2009, 57-58)
>>GIFT culture: "gift culture: little eddies of artifacts accrue around grrrl zines, circulating between zine readers and creators. Zines instigate intimate, affectionate connections between their creators and readers, not just communities but what I am calling embodied communities, made possible by the materiality of the zine medium" (Piepmeier 2009, 58) 
>"By mobilizing particular human experiences that are linked to the body, including vulnerability, affection, and pleasure, these zines leverage their materiality into a kind of surrogate physical interaction and offer mechanisms for creating meaningful relationships." (59)


>"Computing work must therefore be distributed across the people in an organizatìon, not bottlenecked at programming professionals. One piece of the solution to the productivity puzzle then, is to increase the value of computers by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness with which ordinary people use computers to build the applications they need." (Nardi 1993, 123)
>"the overriding goal is to leverage users' skills and interests in the design of a programming system. [...] Computer-centric terms such as "novice" obscure the possibilities for creating appropriate end user systems and are prejudicial in assigning prominence to the computer." (Nardi 1993, 124)
>"The importance of task-specificity in end user systems suggests that the problem of helping end users to be more productive with computers does not lie in extensive education, or in providing scripting languages that are general-purpose but easy" to use, or in finding the ultimate interaction technique. Rather, designers should start with a clear sense of and respect for the tasks that end users will be doing, and then design a system that best supports those tasks." (125)
>**"a recipe for successful end user programming systems includes task specific programming languages, visual application frameworks, and support for collaborative computing practices." (Nardi 1993, 125)**


### process

- many false starts, many attempts at cobbling together imperfect platforms before realizing that it was a complete paradigm shift I am describing? 
- is this a browser extension, a code library, a misuse of an existing tool, a syntax convention and text-scraping script, etc. (Queer Use) ... this is an unanswered question, still imaginging the perfect tool and failing to build it but struggling to find it and tinkering to build it is the way to avoid the writing/thinking



#### outline

CARPA: ideal platform - tethered imagined, IAI
   1. key components, 
      1. a hybrid form of creative-critical-code writing
      2. a platform/tool for creating & experiencing the above kinds of content, expanded experience of text
      3. an artistic research practice that uses both
   2. qualities/characteristics, 
      1. process over product, community collaboration, access, legibility, and the plat/form-content relationship
   3. what comes from where
      1. critical code studies/github: predictive text, syntax highlighting, expanded holistic digital material object / siloed off, limits people's ability to read programming language as part of writing system, forkable & remixable
      2. medium/hypothesis: line-by-line comments, socially embedded, networked across articles, recommendation system
      3. creative writing/gifs
   4. goals/outcomes
      1. critical-code-embedded lyric artistic research essays: lively documents that reveal and enact their own processes, and trace their authors and collaborations
      2. form, platform, approach, and ethic
      3. expanding the accessibility and interpretability of code
      4. invite the bodies who are composing back into our code and our literary forms—and to imagine new forms
