### a process, a material, a form, a platform


### ideal platform (discussion)

A speculative platform for creative-critical-code writing should have these qualities--identified across publishing, programming, and social content management systems (CMS): 
- it's editable
- it's *operable/executable* 
- it's remixable (forking, modular, adaptable)
- it's engageable (commentable, shareable) 
- it's citable/sourceable (modular licensing)
- it's traceable (version tracking, attribution)
- it's language-agnostic (programming is writing)
- it's useful, even fun, INVITING, generative, creative, inspiring
- it's readable/legible/understandable, accessible (are these the same--view it, understand it?)
- it's portable: deplatformable, cross-publishable, distributed/standardized? cloud-hosted/shared
- it's engaging community (represents different interactions 1:1, 1:many, many:many, self:self) 
- it's process-oriented (pre-to-post publication workflow (drafts, revisions, editions; development & production)
- it's robust (enough to withstand the above, which may mean minimalist)
- it's political (ethical, doesn't shy away from its values, embedded in its community)

LEGIBLE: approachable, learnable
MEANINGFUL: participates in material & semantic significance
COMMUNAL: performative, process-oriented, community creativity

comes from two behaviors
TRACEABLE: 
- structurally: FORK, MERGE, MOD, REMIX 
- discursively: COMMENT, ATTRIBUTE
TRANSLUCENT
- structurally: layering meaning
- discursively: accessing learning


### how to invite people in from other disciplines

>>"They gravitate toward zines that are visibly different from magazines and other mainstream publications, either by virtue of size or hand-colored drawings or their sheer unprofessional appearance. [...] Many of them seem to feel personally invited to enter into the zine discourse, as is evidenced by the fact that they begin creating zines of their own." (Piepmeier 2009, 57-58)
>>GIFT culture: "gift culture: little eddies of artifacts accrue around grrrl zines, circulating between zine readers and creators. Zines instigate intimate, affectionate connections between their creators and readers, not just communities but what I am calling embodied communities, made possible by the materiality of the zine medium" (Piepmeier 2009, 58) 
>"By mobilizing particular human experiences that are linked to the body, including vulnerability, affection, and pleasure, these zines leverage their materiality into a kind of surrogate physical interaction and offer mechanisms for creating meaningful relationships." (59)


>"Computing work must therefore be distributed across the people in an organizatìon, not bottlenecked at programming professionals. One piece of the solution to the productivity puzzle then, is to increase the value of computers by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness with which ordinary people use computers to build the applications they need." (Nardi 1993, 123)
>"the overriding goal is to leverage users' skills and interests in the design of a programming system. [...] **Computer-centric terms such as "novice" obscure the possibilities for creating appropriate end user systems and are prejudicial in assigning prominence to the computer."** (Nardi 1993, 124)
>"The importance of task-specificity in end user systems suggests that the problem of helping end users to be more productive with computers does not lie in extensive education, or in providing scripting languages that are general-purpose but easy" to use, or in finding the ultimate interaction technique. Rather, designers should start with a clear sense of and respect for the tasks that end users will be doing, and then design a system that best supports those tasks." (125)
>**"a recipe for successful end user programming systems includes task specific programming languages, visual application frameworks, and support for collaborative computing practices." (Nardi 1993, 125)**



### process

- many false starts, many attempts at cobbling together imperfect platforms before realizing that it was a complete paradigm shift I am describing? 
- is this a browser extension, a code library, a misuse of an existing tool, a syntax convention and text-scraping script, etc. (Queer Use) ... this is an unanswered question, still imaginging the perfect tool and failing to build it but struggling to find it and tinkering to build it is the way to avoid the writing/thinking



#### outline

CARPA: ideal platform - tethered imagined, IAI
   1. key components, 
      1. a hybrid form of creative-critical-code writing
      2. a platform/tool for creating & experiencing the above kinds of content, expanded experience of text
      3. an artistic research practice that uses both
   2. qualities/characteristics, 
      1. process over product, community collaboration, access, legibility, and the plat/form-content relationship
      2. LEGIBLE: approachable, learnable
      3. MEANINGFUL: participates in material & semantic significance
      4. COMMUNAL: performative, process-oriented, community creativity
      5. comes from two behaviors
      6. TRACEABLE: 
         1. - structurally: FORK, MERGE, MOD, REMIX 
         2. - discursively: COMMENT, ATTRIBUTE
      7. TRANSLUCENT
         1. - structurally: layering meaning
         2. - discursively: accessing learning
   3. what comes from where
      1. critical code studies/github: predictive text, syntax highlighting, expanded holistic digital material object / siloed off, limits people's ability to read programming language as part of writing system, forkable & remixable
      2. medium/hypothesis: line-by-line comments, socially embedded, networked across articles, recommendation system
      3. creative writing/gifs
   4. goals/outcomes
      1. critical-code-embedded lyric artistic research essays: lively documents that reveal and enact their own processes, and trace their authors and collaborations
      2. form, platform, approach, and ethic
      3. expanding the accessibility and interpretability of code
      4. invite the bodies who are composing back into our code and our literary forms—and to imagine new forms

> BRIEF MANIFESTOS FOR DIGITAL WRITING PLATFORMS OF THE FUTURE: 
> **Creative-Critical-Code Writing As Artistic Research and Performance**

Thank you to CARPA for this panel. I'm excited to join my fellow panelists and for the chance to speak on this topic. I'm Sarah Ciston, a Mellon Fellow and PhD Candidate at USC, where I research how to make AI more intersectional. My background is in creative writing and creative-critical coding, which I explore through artistic research that does weird things with text-based machine learning to discover its limits and its possibilities. 

Today I will talk about the practice of creative-critical-code writing as artistic research. I want to think of this as both a hybrid practice and a possible shift in how we consider platforms. I'm especially interested in how to bring more ethical and equitable practices to existing spaces and the new ones we create. 

TOC: So first I will make a case for new platforms and forms of hybrid writing, and talk about the goals for ~~important impacts of~~ making this potential shift to creative-critical-code writing.

Then I'll the qualities or characteristics I argue it needs to have that distinguish it from existing modes, and what existing spaces it's inspired by where we see it emerging already. 

Then I'll touch in particular on the aspects of this modality that are performative, process-oriented, and why that matters so much. 

Finally I'll show a few examples that I've begun in my own research practice, which I'm continuing to build on as I develop a prototype platform. 





SLIDE: Jerome McGann argues that “Digital tools have **yet to develop models** for displaying and replicating **the self-reflexive operations** of bibliographical tools [...] for **transforming storage into memory, and data into knowledge**. We have to design and build digital environments for those purposes.” I suggest this requires more than a XXXXXX but a reconfiguration of the relationship between natural and machinic languages that dissolves the areas where we have artificially divided them and artificially divided the work of their authorship. 

They do indeed have unique characteristics, and it is important not to lose that nuance in the process. However, in specialisation, let's not also lose the opportunity to think and write them together in more complex and in depth ways, which we have done. 



I had a lengthy wishlist of characteristics, laundry list of XXXXX, a duct-taped together vision of affordances from various platforms. 

It should have the sociability and comment-friendly interface of a streamlined writing platform like Medium.com. 

It should have the 



I'm starting to put together what these aspects have in common 


Incorporating code supports this by adding **traceability** and **translucence** to the digital writing. 


Examples from my own research where I see this happening and where I have started to put this into practice:

1. Platform experiments in visible code that bring the dev tools that are usually hidden in the web browser forward to be part of the text. In Chrome on a Mac you can right click an element and select Inspect, or a keyboard shortcut is Command+Option+I to bring up the page source, including html, any javascript, and CSS. But what if these were more readily visible through a browser extension or as part of the site itself, lowering the barrier between code and natural language text and lowering the barrier to entry to learning how code affects the other forms of writing it intersects with? Separating it off by hiding it in the developer tools as if only for already-skilled developers treats coding as an elite knowledge form and disallows the opportunity for potential coders to understand and influence these relationships like they could if code text and other writing could co-mingle.
   
2. A second example is in recent work I've undertaken with Mark Marino, in which we were invited to fork a book written on GitLab by Winnie Soon and Geoff Cox. Because the book was
