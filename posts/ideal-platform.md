### ideal platform (discussion)

A speculative platform for creative-critical-code writing should have these qualities--identified across publishing, programming, and social content management systems (CMS): 
- it's editable
- it's operable/executable 
- it's remixable (forking, modular, adaptable)
- it's engageable (commentable, shareable) 
- it's citable/sourceable (modular licensing)
- it's traceable (version tracking, attribution)
- it's language-agnostic (programming is writing)
- it's useful, even fun, INVITING, generative, creative, inspiring
- it's readable/legible/understandable, accessible (are these the same--view it, understand it?)
- it's portable: deplatformable, cross-publishable, distributed/standardized? cloud-hosted/shared
- it's engaging community (represents different interactions 1:1, 1:many, many:many, self:self) 
- it's process-oriented (pre-to-post publication workflow (drafts, revisions, editions; development & production)
- it's robust (enough to withstand the above, which may mean minimalist)
- it's political (ethical, doesn't shy away from its values, embedded in its community)

### how to invite people in from other disciplines

>>"They gravitate toward zines that are visibly different from magazines and other mainstream publications, either by virtue of size or hand-colored drawings or their sheer unprofessional appearance. [...] Many of them seem to feel personally invited to enter into the zine discourse, as is evidenced by the fact that they begin creating zines of their own." (Piepmeier 2009, 57-58)
>>GIFT culture: "gift culture: little eddies of artifacts accrue around grrrl zines, circulating between zine readers and creators. Zines instigate intimate, affectionate connections between their creators and readers, not just communities but what I am calling embodied communities, made possible by the materiality of the zine medium" (Piepmeier 2009, 58) 
>"By mobilizing particular human experiences that are linked to the body, including vulnerability, affection, and pleasure, these zines leverage their materiality into a kind of surrogate physical interaction and offer mechanisms for creating meaningful relationships." (59)


>"Computing work must therefore be distributed across the people in an organizatÃ¬on, not bottlenecked at programming professionals. One piece of the solution to the productivity puzzle then, is to increase the value of computers by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness with which ordinary people use computers to build the applications they need." (Nardi 1993, 123)
>"the overriding goal is to leverage users' skills and interests in the design of a programming system. [...] Computer-centric terms such as "novice" obscure the possibilities for creating appropriate end user systems and are prejudicial in assigning prominence to the computer." (Nardi 1993, 124)
>"The importance of task-specificity in end user systems suggests that the problem of helping end users to be more productive with computers does not lie in extensive education, or in providing scripting languages that are general-purpose but easy" to use, or in finding the ultimate interaction technique. Rather, designers should start with a clear sense of and respect for the tasks that end users will be doing, and then design a system that best supports those tasks." (125)
>**"a recipe for successful end user programming systems includes task specific programming languages, visual application frameworks, and support for collaborative computing practices." (Nardi 1993, 125)**


### process

- many false starts, many attempts at cobbling together imperfect platforms before realizing that it was a complete paradigm shift I am describing? 
- is this a browser extension, a code library, a misuse of an existing tool, a syntax convention and text-scraping script, etc. (Queer Use) ... this is an unanswered question, still imaginging the perfect tool and failing to build it but struggling to find it and tinkering to build it is the way to avoid the writing/thinking
