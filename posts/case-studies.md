## case studies (lit review)

scope, who is already working in overlapping areas, why they inspire this and need building upon into new approaches

### documentation, comment leaning
- Jupyter notebooks & Colab
- [Literate Programming, Knuth](http://www.literateprogramming.com/)
    - >>Ross Williams. FunnelWeb Tutorial Manual, pg 4.In literate programming the emphasis is reversed. Instead of writing code containing documentation, the literate programmer writes documentation containing code. No longer does the English commentary injected into a program have to be hidden in comment delimiters at the top of the file, or under procedure headings, or at the end of lines. Instead, it is wrenched into the daylight and made the main focus. The "program" then becomes primarily a document directed at humans, with the code being herded between "code delimiters" from where it can be extracted and shuffled out sideways to the language system by literate programming tools. //The effect of this simple shift of emphasis can be so profound as to change one's whole approach to programming. Under the literate programming paradigm, the central activity of programming becomes that of conveying meaning to other intelligent beings rather than merely convincing the computer to behave in a particular way. It is the difference between performing and exposing a magic trick.

### use code tools for writing or ease the use of code tools
- *Aesthetic Programming* & other github writing processes
- [ ] [Gitless](https://gitless.com/)!!! What happened to it? & other github for writers moments like [Penflip.com]
- [ ] attempts to make github differently visualised: [OSP VisualCulture](http://osp.kitchen/tools/visualculture/), a kind of website file tree (?) and [Prose](https://github.com/prose/prose/), a kind of CMS filetree (?)
- asides: PhDs writing quals in Glitch, Discord, Google Suite ? 

#### use code itself for writing
- codeworks & code poetry: Jessica Loseby's Code Scares Me (via Rita Raley)
### make code more inviting, rethink it emotionally
- [ ] - p5.js friendly error messages & contributor docs, with disclosure? 
- [ ] Katherine Yang's poetic & emotional esolang **e?xpress**
- aside: [Feminist Solution to A-Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHjsdyN4UK0)


### why these are different & questions
- literate programming still could expand another layer further, focus was still on code as the primary document, whereas can we think more holistically, bring more folks from more disciplines and communities into conversation, produce different kinds of intersecting meaning 
- difference between blog comments and repo comments, top-down bottom-up (JD)
- why is github impenetrable to "outsiders"? its designers imagine it has a logical smooth workflow, coming from that SME domain-specific design doesn't cross over
