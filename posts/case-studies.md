## case studies (lit review)

scope, who is already working in overlapping areas, why they inspire this and need building upon into new approaches

- p5.js friendly error messages & contributor docs, with disclosure? 
- [ ] *Aesthetic Programming* & other github writing processes
- [ ] attempts to make github differently visualised: [OSP VisualCulture](http://osp.kitchen/tools/visualculture/), a kind of website file tree (?) and [Prose](https://github.com/prose/prose/), a kind of CMS filetree (?)
- [ ] Katherine Yang's poetic & emotional esolang **e?xpress**

### widely applied? 
- Jupyter notebooks & Colab

### asides? 
- PhDs writing quals in Glitch, Discord, Google Suite ? 

### not quite on topic but i like it
- [ ] [Feminist Solution to A-Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHjsdyN4UK0)

### historical
- [Literate Programming, Knuth](http://www.literateprogramming.com/)
- ~~Eve~~
- Craig Dietrich's MAGIC
- codeworks & code poetry: Jessica Loseby's Code Scares Me (via Rita Raley)
- Etherpad, SubEthaEdit

### why these are different & questions
- literate programming still could expand another layer further, focus was still on code as the primary document, whereas can we think more holistically, bring more folks from more disciplines and communities into conversation, produce different kinds of intersecting meaning 
- difference between blog comments and repo comments, top-down bottom-up (JD)
- why is github impenetrable to "outsiders"? its designers imagine it has a logical smooth workflow, coming from that SME domain-specific design doesn't cross over
