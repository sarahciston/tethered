### hi, you've reached tethered.network

I'm working on an article about creative-critical code-writing and tools to support it, and here's where I'm doing some thinking and making. Feel free to read along, and add your thoughts on the project's [github archive](https://github.com/sarahciston/tethered).

#### expanded reading: diffs & comments on github

1. click through to the text's archive (repository) on [github](https://github.com/sarahciston/tethered), where you'll see a list of all the files that run this site.

2. just below the green Code button where you can download and remix this code for your own purposes, click the link to the number of **Commits** (or how many times changes have been saved to the repository). You'll get a list of every commit. Click the top (latest), or rewind to an earlier version if you like.

3. now you have a colorful look at every change, green (add) and red (delete), made to each file. AND when you point your cursor at a line, a blue plus sign appears at the left edge. Click on the blue plus sign to leave a comment! If you're in raw text mode you'll also see other readers' comments as well.
