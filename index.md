## 1. a provocation

The way we read code is broken. You are approaching code as a critical code studies scholar, an engineer trying to maintain an open-source library, or a student first learning to distinguish comments from functions—approaches to code that only consider it entirely separate from the content, writing (natural language), and other material it executes fall short of ...   

By its "nature" it is abstracted away, under the hood, behind the scenes, meant to work without the end-user's understanding. The concept of abstraction, its presumed utility, has been so fundamental to computer science that it can be difficult to see beyond it to imagine scenarios where other values might produce other useful systems. 

Yet, entire realms of programming's utility, creative potential, etc may be missed because of siloed insistence that it is "for" some and not others. 


### subject/description

### problem/gap


>"these allopoietic text-processing systems [such as metadata and markup] cannot access or display the autopoietic character of textual fields. Digital tools have yet to develop models for displaying and replicating the self-reflexive operations of bibliographical tools, which alone are operations for thinking and communicating—which is to say, for transforming storage into memory, and data into knowledge.
>"We have to design and build digital environments for those purposes. A measure of their capacity and realization will be whether they can integrate data-function mechanisms like TEI into their higher-order operations." (McGann 2014, 96)


### why & so what

This article sets out to imagine a speculative creative-critical coding-writing platform. It outlines some characteristics for that platform, its goals, and describes ~~why these characteristics help address these goals.~~

**Key components:**

**Qualities/characteristics:**
- open: comments, version tracking, sharing, editable, readable/accessible, portable
- embedded: connected/organic to its community
- ethical:
- 

These goals point to an **ethics of code in community:** 
- We acknowledge code and other forms of text are not so different. They coexist in every space either occupies, at this point. They merge and blur, influence and drift. We are intertwined with them.
- We acknowledge and make legible that no one writes (code or any other text) in a vacuum.  
- We acknowledge code is a commons, it isn't owned, but a love story of what we imagine could and should be in the world, what could and should connect us. If code acts, makes things happen, what do we want to happen? For and with whom? Which stories still need telling?
