### ideal platform (discussion)

A speculative platform for creative-critical-code writing should have these qualities--identified across publishing, programming, and social content management systems (CMS): 
- it's editable
- it's operable/executable 
- it's remixable (forking, modular, adaptable)
- it's engageable (commentable, shareable) 
- it's citable/sourceable (modular licensing)
- it's traceable (version tracking, attribution)
- it's language-agnostic (programming is writing)
- it's useful, even fun, generative, creative, inspiring
- it's readable/legible/understandable, accessible (are these the same--view it, understand it?)
- it's portable: deplatformable, cross-publishable, distributed/standardized? cloud-hosted/shared
- it's engaging community (represents different interactions 1:1, 1:many, many:many, self:self) 
- it's process-oriented (pre-to-post publication workflow (drafts, revisions, editions; development & production)
- it's robust (enough to withstand the above, which may mean minimalist)
