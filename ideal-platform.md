### ideal platform (discussion)

A speculative platform for creative-critical-code writing should have these qualities--identified across publishing, programming, and social content management systems (CMS): 
- it's editable
- it's operable/executable 
- it's remixable (forking, modular, adaptable)
- it's engageable (commentable, shareable) 
- it's citable/sourceable (modular licensing)
- it's traceable (version tracking, attribution)
- it's language-agnostic (programming is writing)
- it's useful, even fun, INVITING, generative, creative, inspiring
- it's readable/legible/understandable, accessible (are these the same--view it, understand it?)
- it's portable: deplatformable, cross-publishable, distributed/standardized? cloud-hosted/shared
- it's engaging community (represents different interactions 1:1, 1:many, many:many, self:self) 
- it's process-oriented (pre-to-post publication workflow (drafts, revisions, editions; development & production)
- it's robust (enough to withstand the above, which may mean minimalist)
- it's political (ethical, doesn't shy away from its values, embedded in its community)



>>"They gravitate toward zines that are visibly different from magazines and other mainstream publications, either by virtue of size or hand-colored drawings or their sheer unprofessional appearance. [...] Many of them seem to feel personally invited to enter into the zine discourse, as is evidenced by the fact that they begin creating zines of their own." (Piepmeier 2009, 57-58)


### process

- many false starts, many attempts at cobbling together imperfect platforms before realizing that it was a complete paradigm shift I am describing? 
- is this a browser extension, a code library, a misuse of an existing tool, a syntax convention and text-scraping script, etc. (Queer Use)
